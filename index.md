## Welcome to Tientien(Daphne) Hsieh's Portfolio

# About Me
Hello and Welcome! I am a software engineer with strong background in python and React.js. I graduated from Hackbright Academy in early 2021 and am very excited to enter the tech world with all new skills I gained. I graduated from UC Davis in 2016 with a degree in Biochemistry. After graduation, I quickly entered the biotech industry and have been working in drug discovery since. During my career as a bench scientist in a high throughput environment, I self-taught python to help me with analyzing complex assay data and manage chemical compound storage. While I enjoy the thrills of doing wet lab experiments, I realized I have a higher affinity to coding and enjoys the debugging and problem-solving process. Thus, I joined Hackbright while the world is adapting to the wrath of COVID. I am excited to enter the tech world with her problem-solving mindset and my new coding skills as a software engineer.

## Projects
### Into the Ghibli world
[_Into the Gibli World_](https://www.intotheghibliworld.com/)\
Into the Ghibli World is a web app to see the locations around the globe that inspire Studio Ghibli movies. Made with a desire to travel during COVID times and my love for Studio Ghibli, this app collected information from several website and allows users to navigate through the google map and see the actual locations and ghibli movies scenes side by side. User can either navigate through the google map directly or use the search bar to search for keywords. With the use of OpenTripApi, users can also see nearby locations and restaurants within a radius of 2000m from the point of interest. Users can also view all the movies from Studio Ghibli and add them to favorites.

### Movie Finder
[_Movie Finder_](http://daphne-hsieh-test01.herokuapp.com/)\
Movie Finder is an web app that I made with React.js to find and nominate movies. omDB API is used as the movie database. User is able to search for movies and nominate them. The nominates would be saved in local storage so as the user leave and come back to the site, the data still persist.

## Experience

### Research Associate II | Revolution Medicines
May 2017 - Feb 2020, Redwood City, CA
- Utilize Python tkinter and openpyxl library to create simple GUI to parse and restructure excel and csv files to streamline high throughput screening data analysis/ compound processing
- Developed and validated 384-well based assays in use for in-house screening and also conduct routine high throughput experiments
- Set up scripts in laboratory robots minimize manual labor

## Hobbies
I am an indoor plant lover and collector. I have collected over 100 exotic rare plants that I imported from Thailand. I occasionally sell them on Facebook and Instagram.
